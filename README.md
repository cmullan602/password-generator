# Password Generator

## Description

- I built this project as part of my challenge for the third week of coding bootcamp. The starting code was given to me with a working HTML and CSS page and I worked to refractor the javascript file. 

- The project contains an index.html file that is linked with a CSS.style and script.js file. 

- I really struggled with writing a for loop that would generate a rondom string for the passowrd. After I figured that part out the rest of it was fairly straightforward. There are a lot of if else statements in my js code and it makes me think that there has to be an easier way to make this work but it does work and that's what matters!
